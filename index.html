                    <p>Animated-inflection will sell new and used musical instruments and accessories. Our primary items
                        will be new band and orchestral instruments, electric and acoustic guitars, amplifiers and
                        electronic keyboards. In addition we will have a full service, on-site repair and customization

                        We will offer a “state of the art” music lesson program featuring top degreed instructors, as
                        part of our overall focus on educating our customer base. This program will include private and
                        group lessons, as well as outreach to local schools. We will also develop music clubs geared to

                        <br><br>
                        Although offering school band and orchestral instruments, service and lessons will be our main
                        competitive advantage, guitars will remain the primary revenue producer for musical instrument

                   <p>This Yamaha Stage Custom Birch mounted tom drum gives you a lot of bang for your buck, whether you're a beginner or a seasoned player. It features the same low fundamental and warm tone that has become a trademark of Yamaha's birch drum designs over the past three decades. Drummers at Sweetwater dig Yamaha's low-mass lugs because of the way that they allow the shells to vibrate, resulting in remarkable tone and sustain. Finished in a beautiful high-gloss lacquer, this Yamaha Stage Custom Birch mounted tom embodies value, quality, and craftsmanship.</p>
