                    <p>The small-bodied Rogue Starter Acoustic Guitar is an amazing deal for a starter guitar. Its
                        smaller profile (7/8" scale) makes it very playable for kids or aspiring guitarists with
                        smaller body frames and hands. It has a maple neck and select hardwood fretboard which
                        produce an exquisite tone. </p>

                    <p>Like a ’60s invasion, the G5422G-12 serves up full hollowbody build and the true Filter’Tron

                        delivers the fearless and electrifying authenticity that has set Gretsch apart as the
                        quintessential rock ‘n’ roll guitars from the very beginning. It’s the sound of honor
                        itself—play proud. Case sold separately.</p>
