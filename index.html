                <br>
                <p>Animated-inflection will sell new and used musical instruments and accessories. Our primary items
                    will be new band and orchestral instruments, electric and acoustic guitars, amplifiers and
                    electronic keyboards. In addition we will have a full service, on-site repair and customization
                    department (band instruments, guitars and electronics).
                    <br><br>
                    We will offer a “state of the art” music lesson program featuring top degreed instructors, as
                    part of our overall focus on educating our customer base. This program will include private and
                    group lessons, as well as outreach to local schools. We will also develop music clubs geared to
                    children and seniors, to further serve our local community.
                    <br><br>
                    Although offering school band and orchestral instruments, service and lessons will be our main
                    competitive advantage, guitars will remain the primary revenue producer for musical instrument
                    stores for the foreseeable future.
